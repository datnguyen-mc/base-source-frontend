/**
 * This Home.jsx page uses the following:
 * - React + react-router-dom → <Link />
 * - Layout wrapper from "../Layout"
 * - Framer Motion for animations → import { motion }
 * - UI components → Card, CardContent from "@/components/ui/card"
 * - Icon set → lucide-react icons: Building2, ShieldCheck, Handshake, TrendingUp, ArrowRight, Newspaper
 *
 * Rules for AI code generation:
 * - Keep the existing imports exactly as they are.
 * - Use Layout as the main wrapper.
 * - Use motion.div and motion components for subtle animations.
 * - Use Card and CardContent for sections, boxes, feature blocks.
 * - Use lucide-react icons for visual elements.
 * - Do not remove any imports unless explicitly requested.
 * - Output must be valid JSX and match the project’s Tailwind design system.
